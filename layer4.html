        <h1>Transport Layer (Layer 4)</h1>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Definition</h2>
            <p>Layer 4 of the OSI model, known as the Transport Layer, is responsible for the end to end delivery of data between devices. It ensures that data sent from one application on a device is properly received and assembled by the correct application on another device.</p>
            <p>The Transport Layer manages how much data is sent, how fast it’s sent, and verifies that it arrives correctly and in order.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Core Functions</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Dividing and Reassembly:</strong> Large data streams from higher layers are divided (segmented) into smaller packets for transmission and reassembled on the receiving end.</li>
                <li><strong>Error Checking:</strong> Uses checksums or sequence numbers to detect errors or lost packets and requests retransmission if needed (in reliable protocols like TCP).</li>
                <li><strong>Flow Control:</strong> Manages the rate of data transmission to prevent overwhelming the receiver.</li>
                <li><strong>Connection Control:</strong> Can operate in connection-oriented (reliable) or connectionless (fast, best-effort) modes and is responsible for logically setting up and tearing down connections.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

            <h2>Examples of Protocols</h2>
            <div class="protocol-comparison">
                <div class="protocol-box">
                    <h3 style="color: #96CEB4;">TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Reliable and connection-based</li>
                        <li>Ensures all packets arrive correctly and in sequence</li>
                        <li>Performs error recovery, retransmission, and flow control</li>
                        <li>Used for applications where accuracy matters more than speed</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                <div class="protocol-box">
                    <h3 style="color: #96CEB4;">UDP (User Datagram Protocol)</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Unreliable and connectionless</li>
                        <li>Sends packets without establishing a dedicated connection</li>
                        <li>Faster, but there is no guarantee of delivery</li>
                        <li>Used for time-sensitive applications</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Real-World Examples</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Web Browsing (HTTP over TCP):</strong> TCP ensures every byte of data (HTML, images, CSS) delivers accurately and in order.</li>
                <li><strong>Video Streaming or Gaming (UDP):</strong> UDP sends data faster by skipping retransmissions; occasional packet loss is tolerated to maintain real-time performance.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Relationship to Other Layers</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>With Layer 3 (Network Layer):</strong> The Transport Layer uses the Network Layer to route packets between devices across networks. The Network Layer handles where the data goes; the Transport Layer manages how it gets there reliably.</li>
                <li><strong>With Layer 5 (Session Layer):</strong> The Transport Layer provides reliable data transfer services that the Session Layer uses to manage ongoing communication sessions.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Summary</h2>
            <p>The Transport Layer ensures data moves safely and correctly between devices: it breaks large amounts of data into smaller parts, reassembles them on receipt, checks for errors, and controls transmission speed. TCP and UDP are the most common transport protocols, offering trade-offs between reliability and speed.</p>
